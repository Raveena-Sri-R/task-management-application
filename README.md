**Task Management Application** This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to efficiently manage tasks. The key purpose of the application is to provide a user-friendly platform for adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks.

### Core Features:
1. **Add Task**: Users can input a task name and description, which gets added to the task list.
2. **View Tasks**: All tasks are displayed in a visually organized list.
3. **Edit Task**: Allows users to update details of an existing task.
4. **Delete Task**: Users can permanently remove a task from the list.
5. **Task Status**: Tasks can be marked as `completed` or `pending` using a toggle option.
6. **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks based on their status.

### Technical Overview:
- **HTML** defines the application layout, including input fields, buttons, and the task display section.
- **CSS** enhances aesthetics with custom styling and ensures responsiveness using media queries.
- **JavaScript** handles functionality like adding tasks to an array, manipulating the DOM for task rendering, and storing data persistently using `localStorage`.

### Advanced Features:
- Tasks persist across sessions using `localStorage`, so refreshing the page retains all tasks.
- A dropdown menu enables task filtering based on their status.
